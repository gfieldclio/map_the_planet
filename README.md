# MapThePlanet

Let’s get mapping

The repo: https://github.com/gfieldclio/map_the_planet

Installation steps:

1. brew install elixir
2. Install https://postgresapp.com/ and click on “initialize” when you first run it. The app will need to be running (elephant in top bar) for your database to be accessible for phoenix.
3. Install node if you don't have it `brew install node`
4. Navigate to `assert/` and run `npm install`
5. Return to root and run `mix setup`
6. Profit

To start your Phoenix server:

- Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
- Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
